Here's the list of all collections on user's cluster: ${collections}
Note that user may mention collection and field names in a different way they are listed here.
For example, they may mention a collection name in plural while it is named here in singular and vice versa.

Do the following with the user message:
1. Extract any potential document ids
2. Extract any potential couchbase collection names
3. Extract any potential couchbase field names for a SQL++ query
5. Extract any potential source code entities (files, classes, methods, functions, variables)
5. If the user intents to execute an action, check if it matches one of the following actionOptions and store the name of the action in the "action" field and any action parameters in the "arguments" field:
    - “OpenDocument”, when user asks you to open a document
    - “CreateCollection”, when user asks you to create a collection
    - “CreateScope", when user asks you to create a scope
    - “ExportCollection”, when user asks you to export a collection

{
  “ids”: <Array Of Strings with the identified document ids>,
  "fields": <Array Of Strings with the identified query fields>,
  “collections”: <Array Of Strings with the identified Collections>,
