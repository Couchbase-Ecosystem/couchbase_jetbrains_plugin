Use the <strong style="color: #6aab73">match_phrase</strong> property to run a match phrase query. The Search Service
searches for exact matches to the phrase you specify.<br><br>
Unlike a <strong style="color: #6aab73">match</strong> query string, a <strong
        style="color: #6aab73">match_phrase</strong> query string can contain spaces without using the operator
property.<br><br>

To use a match phrase query:<br>
&rarr;You must specify a field to search with the field property or the {field-name} syntax in your search query.<br>
&rarr;You must have Include Term Vectors enabled or the include_term_vectors property set to true on the field you want
to<br>
search.
