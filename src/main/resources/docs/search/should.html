Use a <strong style="color: #6aab73">should</strong> object to create a boolean query.<br><br>

A <strong style="color: #6aab73">should</strong> object must contain a disjuncts array. The array lists all the queries
that must have a match in a document to
score the document higher in search results.<br><br>

A document can be included in search results if it does not match the query or queries in a <strong
        style="color: #6aab73">should</strong> object. The document
scores higher in search results if it does match the query.
