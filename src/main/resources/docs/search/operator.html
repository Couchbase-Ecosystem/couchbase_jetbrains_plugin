Use the <strong style="color: #6aab73">operator</strong> property to modify the behavior of a match query:<br><br>

&rarr; <strong style="color: #6aab73">"and"</strong>: Any spaces between terms in the match property are interpreted as
the AND
operator. Documents must match all of the terms in the query.<br><br>

&rarr; <strong style="color: #6aab73">"or"</strong>: Any spaces between terms in the match property are interpreted as
the OR
operator. Documents must match at least
one of the terms in the query.<br><br>

For example, if you set a <strong style="color: #6aab73">match</strong> property to the value "good great" and the
<strong style="color: #6aab73">operator</strong> property to "and", the Search Service only returns matches for
documents that contain good and great.<br><br>

If you set the <strong style="color: #6aab73">operator</strong> property to "or", a document only needs to contain one
of the terms from the <strong style="color: #6aab73">match</strong> property: good or great.<br><br>
