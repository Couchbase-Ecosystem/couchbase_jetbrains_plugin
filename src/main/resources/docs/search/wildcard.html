Use the <strong style="color: #6aab73">wildcard</strong> property to run a wildcard query.<br><br>

Set the property to a regular expression that includes a wildcard character in the middle or end of a search term:<br>

&rarr;Use <strong style="color: #6aab73">?</strong> to allow a match to any single character.<br>

&rarr;Use <strong style="color: #6aab73">*</strong> to allow a match to zero or many characters.<br><br>

For example, you could set the <strong style="color: #6aab73">wildcard</strong> property to "inter*" to return
matches
for "interview", "interject", "internal", and so on.<br><br>

You cannot place the wildcard character at the start of the search term.<br><br>

If you use the <strong style="color: #6aab73">wildcard</strong> property, the Search Service does not use any analyzers
on the contents of your query text.<br><br>
