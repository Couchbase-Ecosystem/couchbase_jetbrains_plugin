Use the <strong style="color: #6aab73">ctl</strong> object to make sure that the Search Service runs your Search query
against the latest version of the
documents in your database.<br><br>

The <strong style="color: #6aab73">ctl</strong> object and its properties cause the Search Service to run your query
against the latest version of a document written to a vBucket. The Search Service uses a consistency vector to
synchronize the last document write to a vBucket from the Data Service with the Search index.
