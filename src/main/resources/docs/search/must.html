Use a <strong style="color: #6aab73">must</strong> object to create a boolean query.<br><br>

A <strong style="color: #6aab73">must</strong> object must contain a conjuncts array. The array lists all the queries
that must have a match in a document to include the document in search results.<br><br>

For example, a query could have a <strong style="color: #6aab73">must</strong> object with 2 queries in a conjuncts
array. The Search Service must find a match
for both those queries in a document to include it in search results.
