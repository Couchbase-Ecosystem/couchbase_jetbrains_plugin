Use the <strong style="color: #6aab73">prefix</strong> property to run a prefix query.<br><br>

Set the property to a string to return matches for any term that starts with that string in search results.<br><br>

For example, you could set the <strong style="color: #6aab73">prefix</strong> property to "inter" to return matches for
"interview", "internal", "interesting", and so
on.<br><br>

If you use the prefix property, the Search Service does not use any analyzers on the contents of your query
text.<br><br>
