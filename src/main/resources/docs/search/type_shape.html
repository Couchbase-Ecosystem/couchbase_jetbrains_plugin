<strong style="color: #6aab73">type</strong> defines the shape of the GeoJson Query<br><br>
The allowed values are the following:<br><br>

&rarr;<strong> "Point"</strong>: Use a GeoJSON Point query to search for a single latitude and longitude coordinate that
intersects or is contained inside a GeoJSON shape in your documents<br><br>
&rarr;<strong> "LineString"</strong>: Use a GeoJSON LineString query to search for a line of coordinates that intersects
or is contained inside a GeoJSON shape in your documents<br><br>
&rarr;<strong> "Polygon"</strong>: Use a GeoJSON Polygon query to search for a defined area that intersects, is
contained
inside, or surrounds a GeoJSON shape in your documents<br><br>
&rarr;<strong> "MultiPoint"</strong>: Use a GeoJSON MultiPoint query to search for multiple coordinate points that
intersect or are contained inside a GeoJSON shape in your documents<br><br>
&rarr;<strong> "MultiLineString"</strong>: Use a GeoJSON MultiLineString query to search for multiple LineStrings that
intersect or are contained inside a GeoJSON shape in your documents<br><br>
&rarr;<strong> "MultiPolygon"</strong>: Use a GeoJSON MultiPolygon query to search for a group of defined Polygons that
intersect, are contained inside, or surround a GeoJSON shape in your documents<br><br>
&rarr;<strong> "GeometryCollection"</strong>: Use a GeoJSON GeometryCollection query to search for a group of defined
Points, LineStrings, or Polygons that intersect, are contained inside, or surround a GeoJSON shape in your
documents<br><br>
&rarr;<strong> "Circle"</strong>: Use a GeoJSON Circle query to search in a radius around a single latitude and
longitude coordinate<br>
&rarr;<strong> "Envelope"</strong>: Use a GeoJSON Envelope query to search in a bounded rectangle, based on a pair of
coordinates that define the minimum and maximum longitude and latitude:<br><br>
