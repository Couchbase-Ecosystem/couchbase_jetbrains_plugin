Set the maximum time, in milliseconds, that a Search query can execute on a Search index partition.<br><br>

If the query time exceeds the <strong style="color: #6aab73">timeout</strong>, the Search Service cancels the query. The
query might return partial results if
any index partitions responded before the timeout.
