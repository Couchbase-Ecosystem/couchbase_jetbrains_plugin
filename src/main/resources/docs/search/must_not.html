Use a <strong style="color: #6aab73">must_not</strong> object to create a boolean query.<br><br>

A <strong style="color: #6aab73">must_not</strong> object must contain a disjuncts array. The array lists all the
queries that must have a match in a document to include the document in search results.<br><br>

For example, a query could have a <strong style="color: #6aab73">must_not</strong> object with 3 queries in a disjuncts
array. The Search Service must not find a match for any of the 3 queries in a document to include it in search
results.<br><br>
