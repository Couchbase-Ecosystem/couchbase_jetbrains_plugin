Set whether the Search Service should return documents that contain the exact <strong
        style="color: #6aab73">start</strong> value.<br><br>

If you set <strong style="color: #6aab73">inclusive_start</strong> to false, only dates later than start count as a
match to your Search query.<br><br>

If you do not set the <strong style="color: #6aab73">inclusive_start</strong> value, by default, <strong
        style="color: #6aab73">start</strong> is inclusive to the range.
