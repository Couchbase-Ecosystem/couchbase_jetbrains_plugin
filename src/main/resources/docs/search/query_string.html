<h2>Query String Query Syntax</h2>
<br>
<small>
    Query String queries let you express more complex queries with a special syntax. You can reduce the properties you
    need
    to specify for a Search query with Query String syntax.

    If you do not add any additional Query String syntax to a query, the Search Service interprets the query as a match
    query.

    <ul>
        <li><strong style="color: #6aab73">^</strong>&nbsp;: If you use multiple clauses in a query, you can use the ^
            operator to assign the relative importance to a clause.
        </li>
        <li><strong style="color: #6aab73">&gt;, &gt;=, &lt; and &lArr;</strong>&nbsp;: You can run two types of range
            queries with the later than (&gt;), later than or equal to (&gt;=), earlier than (&lt;), and earlier
            than or equal to (&lArr;) operators:
        </li>
        <li><strong style="color: #6aab73">\</strong>&nbsp;: Use a backslash character (\) to escape characters in a
            Query String query.
        </li>
        <li><strong style="color: #6aab73">{field-name}</strong>&nbsp;: Set the field in a document where the Search
            Service should search for your query by adding a field name and a colon to the start of a search term.
            Use dot notation for the field name. For example, parentField.childField.
        </li>
        <li><strong style="color: #6aab73">+</strong> and <strong style="color: #6aab73">-</strong>&nbsp;: Use the + and
            - operators before a clause in a Query
            String query to run a boolean query.The + operator adds the clause to the MUST list of a boolean query. The
            - operator adds the clause to the MUST_NOT list of a boolean query.
        </li>
    </ul>
